# Graphify - The easiest way to make graphs!

Graphify is a simple web application that uses jQuery visualize to automatically generate graphs from table.
It supports line, area, bar, and pie graphs.

# Notes

Graphify doesn't work in localhost because cross-domain policies are slightly different for localhost which makes graphify unable to utilize iframe dynamically.
